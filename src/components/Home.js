      The prophet (saw) said "Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day (of Judgment) should not harm his neighbour.
      Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day should host his guest generously.
      And anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day should say what is good or keep quiet." (Sahih Bukhari)
      The prophet (saw) said "If anyone continually asks forgiveness, Allah will appoint for him a way out of every distress, relief from anxiety, and will provide for him from where he never realized." (Abu Dawud)
